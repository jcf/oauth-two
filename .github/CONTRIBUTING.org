All code should closely adhere to the [[https://github.com/bbatsov/clojure-style-guide][Clojure style guide]] to save us all from
tedious debates. Use [[https://github.com/weavejester/cljfmt][cljfmt]] to tidy things up if you're unsure.

All changes require accompanying tests, unless your changes are only related to
documentation.

Pull requests should change one thing, and one thing only. One change per
commit. For example, avoid reformatting a file in the same commit as adding a
new feature or fixing a bug.

Please make sure you've updated any relevant documentation, and feel free to add
more. American English in code, British English in prose.
