#+TITLE: Changes

* 0.3.0
Rename scopes to scope everywhere.

You'll need to change the map you pass into ~make-client~ and/or
~authorization-url~ so that instead of passing ~:scopes~ you pass ~:scope~.

Before:

#+begin_src clojure
  (def client
    (make-client {:scopes #{"read"}}))

  (authorization-url client {:scopes #{"read" "write" "admin"}})
#+end_src

And now:

#+begin_src clojure
  (def client
    (make-client {:scope #{"read"}}))

  (authorization-url client {:scope #{"read" "write" "admin"}})
#+end_src

* 0.2.0
Make useful schema like ~ClientConfig~, ~AuthorizationParams~, and
~TokenRequestParams~ public so they can be used in third-party code that wants
to validate the boundary between them and us.
